## **Who Are We?**

**Wayable** is a non profit project, that was born with the aim of helping the community of people with disabilities.

Currently, people with disabilities do not know if shops or places are accessible, and if the arrival at a certain place is comfortable.

## Wayable Solution

Our app is a rating platform that allows people with disabilities to know the level of accessibility of places and businesses, based on reports uploaded by users.
The app will create a reliable community where users will be able to contribute their experiences and share the information about accessibility of various places and businesses.

The app allows the users to search for places based on various criteria, from wheelchair accessibility, convenient parking nearby, physical accessibility to the building and more.
Also, the app will allow the user to rate places based on the same criteria so that other users can also benefit from this important information. The rating will be updated in real time according to user reviews.

The accessibility indices that will appear in the application are in line with the principles of accessibility law, and in particular with the standards published by the Equal Opportunities Commission. The user interface will be accessible and simple so that all people with disabilities will use it comfortably.
